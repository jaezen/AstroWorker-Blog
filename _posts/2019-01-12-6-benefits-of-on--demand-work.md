# And why you should consider it
#### By Stanley Chow


Let’s not kid ourselves: 9-5 jobs aren’t for everyone. For one, the hours are long. Thanks to mobile technology that allows bosses or clients to reach you anytime, the “9-5” concept has become an outdated notion, increasingly blurring the proverbial work-life balance line. It’s not uncommon for full-timers to take their jobs home and continue working after dinner or before bedtime. And assuming you don’t live near your office, factoring in a daily commute will have you wishing there were more hours in a day. 

Then there’s the issue of working for someone. An employee’s motivation is often a function of the recognition and support received from his or her boss, which is by no means a guarantee. Unsupportive or even abusive managers are quite common in the workplace, which can lead to low employee morale. In fact, a global study has revealed that an astonishing 79% of people quit their steady-paying jobs, citing “lack of appreciation” as their main reason. 

While the obvious upside of full-time jobs is income stability, you’re undeniably trading your time and sense independence. So what then is the alternative?

## Introducing On-Demand Jobs
Unless you’re living in complete isolation, you’ve probably heard of ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. These companies specialize in transporting people to their destinations. But unlike traditional taxi services, the person behind the wheel isn’t a professional driver, but an ordinary person driving his own car. And he’s likely not chauffeuring all day, rather using only his spare time to earn some extra income. And therein lies the beauty of companies like Uber: an entire industry is created for those looking for part-time work at their own convenience. This “on-demand” market creates services for consumers who want them instantly, and more importantly, jobs for people who have the means to provide them. On-demand work is ideal for people who want to be their own boss or want flexibility in their schedules. If you’re still on the fence about doing on-demand work, here are some things to think about.

## Easy and quick to start
Compared with traditional jobs, which require candidate screening and multiple rounds of interviews that can last a few months, the process for landing on-demand jobs is lightning quick. As long as you have the principle skills to provide the service and pass a background check, you can usually get approved within a week. Depending on the type of service, most jobs will likely require you to be at least 21 years old, have a valid driver’s license with insurance, and have authorization to work in the country. On-demand jobs have a low barrier to entry, making it perfect for anyone looking to earn money fast.

## Flexibility
The great thing about on-demand jobs is sheer flexibility. There are no set hours. Most jobs don’t even need you to go to an office. Just work around your neighborhood or wherever you’re currently at. This allows you to truly set your own schedule and work when it’s best for you. Have some spare time between now and your next appointment? Make the most of it by delivering some packages and earn some money. Have you been delivering food for an hour and suddenly feel tired? Just drop off that last order and head home for some early rest. And if you’re planning an upcoming vacation trip, just block out that period of your calendar! Don’t make life revolve around your work, make work revolve around your life.

## Be your own boss
For anyone who’s ever felt boxed in by their boss’s expectations, this one’s for you. Much like setting your own schedule, on-demand jobs let you set your own style and culture. Besides following some basic company mandates, on-demand jobs let you decide how long to work, when to start (and end), even what to wear. But most importantly, you get to be your own boss. That means there’s no one to report to except yourself, relieving you of the pressure to perform for someone. On-demand jobs are handing the power back to the people who are putting in the hard work. 

## Earn as much as you want
A common complaint from salaried workers is the flat income earned from their jobs. Under federal law, salaried employees are supposed to cap out at 40-hour work weeks. But the reality is, employees are likely working closer to 50 to 60-hour work weeks and probably not getting compensated a penny more. With on-demand jobs, the earning potential is nearly limitless. As an independent contractor, there is no hard cap on what can be earned. If you have the time and the drive, you can make as much money as you want. The amount of work you put in is equally compensated, making on-demand workers feel like they’re in full control of what they can make.  

## Do what you love
If driving people around isn’t your thing, no problem! On-demand jobs don’t just stop at ride-hailing services; jobs of all kinds exist to suit your interests and hobbies. This includes day-to-day tasks like grocery shopping and cleaning houses. If you love dogs, earn some income by walking them! Lacking exercise? More physical tasks like home repair, moving furniture and warehouse work will have you working a sweat and getting paid for it. And if you’re certified in a specific trade such as massage therapy or tutoring, there’s on-demand opportunities for that too, which can be even more lucrative. All types of opportunities are out there and it’s just a matter of finding the job you enjoy doing most.
 
## Jump in
If you’re looking for an easy way to add extra income and make the most of your free time, on-demand jobs presents a perfect opportunity for you. More and more services that were once fulfilled by company staff are now replaced by anyone with the time and desire to make some extra money to provide for their loved ones. The benefits are undeniable and the opportunities are diverse as they are endless. You’ll be doing work that’s both rewarding for you and your family.
